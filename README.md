Use a Content Delivery Network

Using a CDN can further speed up how quickly your pages load for users. A CDN is a network of servers, usually located at various sites around the world. These servers cache the static content of your site, such as images, CSS and JavaScript files. When someone lands on your site, the static content is served from the server located closest to the user’s physical location. Shorter distances to the server means faster data retrieval. But keep in mind that if the majority of your site visitors are local, a CDN isn’t necessary – CDN’s are more suited to websites that have international traffic.

With WP Rocket, you can integrate your website with CloudFlare, a popular CDN. Go to the “CDN” tab in WP Rocket to enable CloudFlare and then add your account. For more, check out WP Rocket’s documentation on how to use CloudFlare with WP Rocket.

While Cloudflare is a useful free option for users with small websites, larger websites should invest in a premium service, such as MaxCDN (now StackPath), KeyCDN or even an open source option like jsDelivr.
